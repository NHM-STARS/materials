# Advancing Computational And Data Literacy Skills Schools For Life Scientists At The Natural History Museum London

## Aims and objectives

Recent advances in technology have made it easy to generate and collect vast amounts of data. 
Thus ever more scientists are dealing with very large datasets that have opened up the possibility of answering novel questions that were previously not possible. 
Unfortunately with "big data" come "big problems" with managing, analysing and interpreting such data.
Computational and data literacy skills among researchers are vital to ensure that we do miss out on opportunities to derive insights from big data. 
Despite widespread recognition of the importance of such skills, training in these areas has been severely lacking. 
To address these critical training gaps, this skills school's aim is **to train scientists in computational and data literacy skills.** 
This fits under STARS priority area: **Maths, statistics and computational biology**.

The specific objectives are as follows.

1. Train participants in data literacy skills, including 
    (i) efficient collection of data and metadata for future analyses, 
    (ii) data wrangling, tidying, and organisation in R, 
    (iii) data visualisation and analysis in R.
2. Teach participants basic tools for reproducible science, including 
    (i) reproducible report creation,
    (ii) version control.
3. Introduce participants to Open Science principles and procedures, including 
    (i) data archiving options and best practice, 
    (ii) code sharing options and best practice.
4. Introduce participants to the fundamentals of programming, including 
    (i) programming basics in R,
    (ii) the principles of tidy code and code review.
5. Create a community of data literate UK-based scientists, who can conduct innovative and effective research using their data literacy skills, and transfer these skills to their peers and beyond.

All skills will be taught using freely-available software. 
Data manipulation, visualisation, analysis and programming skills will use the statistical computing language R (cran.r-project.org). 
R is widely used across Life Sciences because it is free, flexible, cutting-edge, and has an active community of users developing new packages and online help. 
R is also an in demand skill both within and outside academia.

In summary, this skills school will bring together world leading experts in the field of computational and data literacy teaching and the iconic Natural History Museum, to train a diverse group of participants from across Life Sciences in computational and data literacy skills.

### Strategic Need
A vast and rapidly growing pool of biological data presents opportunities to address key challenges at continental and global scales, particularly as computing power is increasing simultaneously. 
A fundamental issue that seriously impedes progress in scaling up scientific understanding of the world through large-scale data is the widespread lack of capacity among researchers in the Life Sciences for doing data-intensive science. 

A recent survey of graduate students in the environmental sciences is eye opening. 
Over 80% of students received no formal training in computing or informatics at even the most basic level, and 74% had no skills in any programming language. 
While 72% of the students said they understood the term "metadata", about half had not created metadata for their dissertation data and had no plans to do so (BRAEMBL community survey report, EMBL Australia, 2013).
This is a worrying trend.

The strategic importance of computing skills is also highlighted in the 2015 *BBSRC and MRC Review of Vulnerable Skills and Capabilities*, that identified computational biology skills as vulnerable.
The report states that these skills are lacking particularly at the postgraduate and postdoc levels, and that training courses are in high demand and limited supply. 
The report also identified a need for increased knowledge in PIs and postdocs.
Our skills school will focus on these strategic requirements, and will provide training for postgrads, postdocs and PIs. 

We will remedy these issues by training participants in a variety of computational and data literacy skills. 
Such skills are vital for all scientific areas mentioned in BBSRC's remit (climate change, aging, and sustainability) among others, and fit with BBSRC's strategy to provide skilled researchers for academic and industrial research in the UK.

### Importance to the UK 
Data science skills are in high demand in the UK-workforce, both within and outside academia.
This course will provide training in these skills, and will create a community of UK-based data scientists able to conduct more innovative and effective research and to transfer these skills to others.
This will increase the pool of applicants for postdocs requiring these skills, and upskill current and future PIs so they can train their own groups. Additionally, these skills are highly valued outside of academia, increasing the range of career possibilities for students and postdocs.

### Benefits to the participants
Participants will leave the course with new data science skills, but more importantly with the confidence to apply these to their own projects and to continue learning after the course. 
All components will use widely available open-source software, allowing participants to easily incorporate them into their normal workflows without any additional costs.
The skills they acquire will allow them to effectively collect and work with data for their projects, and to share what they have learned with their peers and beyond.
They will also gain a valuable network of researchers working in disparate disciplines, but with similar data and computing requirements, that they can turn to for advice in the future.
In addition, they will have the unique experience of working with historic museum collections that are not open to the public.
Finally, we will ask BBSRC participants in the first cohort to help modify and deliver the course for the second cohort, providing them with career development and leadership opportunities.

### Need for support outside of normal mechanisms
The objectives of this award would be impossible to meet under any other mechanism.
Research Council funding focuses on discipline specific problems, whereas the data literacy skills shortage applies across disciplines, including BBSRC science funding areas. 
Additionally, researchers with the skills to teach such a course are low in number and in very high demand.
Without a STARS award this opportunity would be lost.

## Activities and Participants
The skills school will consist of two courses, about a year apart, each over five days at the Natural History Museum. 
This will be a residential course because it facilitates group project work, provides extra time for networking and peer learning, and ensures that participants from distant locales can attend. 
There will be two cohorts to ensure maximum impact in developing national-level capacity by including participants from as many different ROs as possible.

There will be 20 participants a year (40 in total).
This is the ideal number of participants; small enough that each person gets individual attention, and large enough that participants can network with and learn from each other.
Participants are expected to include postgraduate students, postdocs and PIs from diverse disciplines and ROs. 
We anticipate high demand for the course, so participants will be selected to maximise the coverage of ROs and disciplines represented. 
BBSRC funded individuals will have priority, and only a small minority of participants from the NHM will be accepted. 
These measures will increase the impact of the course, spreading skills to diverse ROs and disciplines, and also increase networking opportunities among ROs.
Experience levels of the participants will range from complete beginners to those with a fair knowledge of some skills. 
This diversity of experience will enhance peer learning during the course.
 
Teaching will be delivered as a combination of short lectures and practical exercises. 
This has proved a very effective way of teaching computational skills: lectures provide participants with the required theoretical background and practical exercises consolidate these skills in the context of real data.
Participants will also collect data from museum collections for use throughout the course and present analyses using this data at the end of the week. 
This provides a unique learning opportunity as participants will use collections that are not accessible to the public. 
Pedagogically, this exercise will allow participants to apply the skills they have learned, consolidating their learning. 
The data collected will be used in computer practical exercises throughout the course, increasing participant engagement and understanding compared to using simulated data.
In addition, they will work in groups, providing networking and peer learning opportunities. 
Finally, as this is a residential course, there will be additional evening activities, including opportunities for informal networking, and an evening meetup with members of the London data science community.
This combination of activities will make this course completely unique within computational biology courses.

They will present their results to the rest of the cohort, and conduct code review for other groups.

Participants will also be asked to complete a comprehensive evaluation form. 
Feedback from the first cohort will be used to improve content for the second cohort.
The tutors will also engage in a thorough debrief to evaluate whether the objectives were met and understand how training methods could be improved in the future.

The NHM has excellent classroom facilities with appropriate AV equipment, highly skilled Technology Solutions staff to deal with any IT issues, and dedicated administrative support for booking accommodation etc.
Additionally, the course will use some of the 80 million specimens held in the world-class natural history collections to deliver a truly unique learning experience to participants. 

## Management and Partnerships

### Partnerships
Dr Karthik Ram, the external collaborator on this project, is a founding member of both rOpenSci and The Data Carpentry project and will contribute to curriculum development and delivery of the skills school.
rOpenSci (http://ropensci.org) is an effort that aims to provide tools and training to facilitate access to open scientific data from around the web. 
The project has tens of thousands of users around the world and over a hundred scientists who contribute to the effort.
The Data Carpentry project (http://www.datacarpentry.org/) aims to teach fundamental concepts, skills and tools for working more effectively with data.

The content of the skills school will be developed collaboratively by Dr Natalie Cooper and Dr Karthik Ram, with additional input from other members of the rOpenSci and Data Carpentry communities. 
There are many advantages of this collaboration, including access to teaching materials developed by these organisations, provision of highly-experienced tutors, and the availability of a network of experts to solicit for ideas.
There are also additional benefits to the participants.
Both organisations have a community of users and a network of previous trainees to seek help from. 
They also have links with data scientists across academia and industry, providing valuable networking and career development opportunities for participants. 

Dr Karthik Ram and one of his rOpenSci colleagues will also deliver the course, and will not charge for their services.

A letter of additional support from Dr Karthik Ram is provided as an attachment on Je-S.

### Management of activities
NHM administrators will arrange registration, travel, and lodging for participants and instructors and also provide catering for the entire event.
NHM Technology Solutions staff will set up IT equipment.
Dr Natalie Cooper with liaise with participants, NHM staff and tutors before, during and after the course.
Dr Natalie Cooper, Dr Karthik Ram, an additional tutor (as yet unconfirmed, but will be a member of rOpenSci) and one NHM postdoc will deliver the course.
There are no appropriate BBSRC postdocs at the NHM to help with the first cohort, however, we will ask BBSRC participants in the first cohort to help modify and deliver the course for the second cohort, providing them with career development and leadership opportunities.
At the end of the course, teaching material will be made freely available on the internet.


## Justification of Costs and BBSRC support

### Workshop delivery costs 

- 40 days for lead tutor Natalie Cooper to cover preparation time, lecturing and administering the course (£8800). 10 days each for two other tutors (£11,351). All three are world-leaders in computational biology teaching, and have extensive experience with similar courses thus are cost effective for the high quality of training they will provide.
- 6 days for NHM curatorial staff to prepare collections and supervise practicals (£1320). This will be a unique aspect of the course and a fantastic learning aid.
- 10 days for PDRA to assist with course (£1766). With 20 participants it is vital to have extra qualified staff on hand to deal with issues as they arise.
- 6 days for Technology Solutions staff to set up IT equipment and provide support for IT issues during the course (£996).
- 20 days for administrative support to deal with catering etc. and to book travel and accommodation for participants and tutors (£3320). This is a time consuming activity especially in central London.

### Participant travel and subsistence

- 10 nights accommodation with breakfast (£16,200). We anticipate 10% of participants will live near London and will not need accommodation. 
- Travel contribution for transport to London, so participants from distant locales can attend (£5000).
- NHM catering for lunches and refreshments (this will also cover tutors; £2465). This increases flexibility of course timings as no-one has to venture off to find lunch or coffee. It also adds to the networking aspects of the course.

### USA tutor travel and subsistence

- Return flights from USA to London (£3600). 
- 14 nights accommodation in central London with breakfast and dinner included (£4850). 14 nights allow a day of preparation before each course, and a day after each for debrief.

Indirect (£20,339) and Estates (£5593) costs have been charged at the standard rate for 122 days personnel time.
**These were not funded so the overall award is £27,000.**

### BBSRC support

We are requesting £52,871 from BBSRC to support this course (63% of the total). US tutors will provide world class teaching skills and materials *pro bono*. NHM will pay 25% of NHM staff costs. The biggest cost is participant accommodation, however we feel this is essential. Residential courses allow greater flexibility of course timings, facilitate group project work, provide extra time for networking and peer learning, and ensure that participants from distant locales can attend. This improves the learning experience and the impact of learning outcomes.

**Indirects and Estates were not funded so the overall award is £27,000.**

The skills school will consist of two residential courses, about a year apart, each over five days at the Natural History Museum London. There will be 20 participants a year, including postgraduate students, postdoctoral researchers and principal investigators from diverse disciplines and research organisations. 

The skills school will be led by Dr Natalie Cooper (Natural History Museum), a researcher with over ten years of experience teaching computing and statistics skills to scientists, and Dr Karthik Ram (University of California, Berkeley), a world-leading instructor in the field, and founding member of two organisations (rOpenSci and Data Carpentry) designed to improve computational skills training for scientists. Teaching will be delivered as a combination of short lectures and practical exercises.

Data science skills are in high demand in the UK-workforce, both within and outside academia.
This course will provide training in these skills, and will create a community of UK-based data scientists able to conduct more innovative and effective research and to transfer these skills to others. Participants will leave the course with new data science skills, but more importantly with the confidence to apply these to their own projects and to continue learning after the course. Additionally, these skills are highly valued outside of academia, increasing the range of career possibilities for participants after the course.

In summary, this skills school will bring together world leading experts in the field of computational and data literacy teaching and the iconic Natural History Museum London to train a diverse group of participants from across Life Sciences in computational and data literacy skills. These skills will assist them in their research and career prospects, and also increase national capacity for data driven research and data science training.
